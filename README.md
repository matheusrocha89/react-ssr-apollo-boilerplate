# React SSR Apollo Boilerplate

A boilerplate to start code your project using react, react-apollo, react-router v4, ssr, webpack and express.

## Motivation

Everytime we need to create a new project we lose a lot of time configuring the workspace and environment with all the
tools that we use today to build web apps or you just start to copy and paste these parts from other older projects that you have.

So I created this to make it easier for me to start new projects and I think it could help other developers too.

## Installation

Just clone the project and install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

 Or if you have a little bit of self love:

 ```
 yarn
 ```
